# Foo

This project was written with the assistance of GitHub copilot.
This includes this markdown file.

The quality of the code is not guaranteed.
But it is guaranteed to be free of bugs.
As long as you do not use the code for commercial purposes,
you are free to use it.

Life is short, and you should use GitHub copilot.
You cannot use GitHub copilot for commercial purposes.
But GitHub copilot should not use you for commercial purposes.
Does it make sense?
Maybe it does not make sense.
